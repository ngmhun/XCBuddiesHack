Xcontest Air Buddies - add any flight with a greasemonkey script
* Install the Tampermonkey extension in Chromium (I did not try other browser and Greasemonkey yet)
* Install the [XCBuddiesHack.user.js](https://github.com/ngmhun/XCBuddiesHack/raw/main/XCBuddiesHack.user.js)
* Go to the [Daily score PG page](https://www.xcontest.org/world/en/flights/daily-score-pg/) on xcontest.org 
* Or go to the [flight search page](https://www.xcontest.org/world/en/flights-search/) on xcontest.org 
* You should see a new button in the top menu: **Select flights**
* By pressing this button, checkboxes will appear in the flight list
* You can select any number of flight with these checkboxes
* Then you can go to a flight and there you will have another button: **Add flights**
* By pressing the Add flights button, yout previously selected flights will appear above the "Air Buddies" list, where you can add these flights to the map with the checkboxes
